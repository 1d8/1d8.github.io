      <description>INotify Background Inotify is a Linux utility that allows users to monitor changes that are made to the filesystem and reports on such changes. Inotify comes with an API that can be used programmatically as well as command-line tools that can be used.
If you wanted to monitor a specific directory or file for changes, you would run inotifywait &amp;lt;directory/file&amp;gt;. Then when an event occurs to the specified directory/file, it&amp;rsquo;d report on it:</description>

      <description>Description: This post contains a set of Ansible commands that I&amp;rsquo;ve used recently to explore systems (both Linux &amp;amp; Windows) &amp;amp; enumerate different information about them!
Setup Ansible Module We can use the setup Ansible module which returns a wealth of information about the machine we&amp;rsquo;re accessing! We can run it as a one-liner by running: ansible all -i &amp;lt;IP Address&amp;gt;, -m setup -e &amp;quot;ansible_user=&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; ansible_password=&amp;lt;password&amp;gt; ansible_shell_type=powershell ansible_connection=ssh host_key_checking=false&amp;quot; and this would output:</description>

      <description>Description: This post will dive into the topic of LLMNR poisoning, specifically what the LLMNR protocol is, how we could poison it, and diving into what it looks like in a packet capture
Lab Setup In my lab setup, I have 3 machines:
 Kali Linux machine representing the threat actor  IP address - 192.168.56.107   Windows workstation representing the victim  IP address - 192.168.56.118   Windows server representing the Domain Controller (DC)  IP address - 192.</description>

      <description>Description: Hunting for the presence of Impacket&amp;rsquo;s WmiExec commands on a host by calculating &amp;amp; graphing entropy
This blog post will dive into calculating and graphing the entropy of Powershell commands in an attempt to discover the use of impacket&amp;rsquo;s wmiexec.py tool. The data set we&amp;rsquo;ll be using is in a CSV format and is exported from SysInternals&#39; Process Monitor (ProcMon) tool. I generated this data by running benign commands, then using wmiexec to remotely log into a system &amp;amp; running some commands as well.</description>

      <title>Threat Emulation Series - Introduction - Event Triggered Execution</title>
      <link>https://1d8.github.io/publications/threatactemulation_1/</link>

      <description>Description: This post is an introductory post to a series of blog posts that I&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into which will detail emulating threat actors and their associated TTPs with code.
In this particular blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into the topic of persistence which can be accomplished by manipulating Windows registry key values! Specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll be examining the Event Trigger Execution Technique in which an attacker modify system mechanisms to gain execution based upon specific events.</description>

      <title>Threat Hunting With Pandas</title>

      <description>Description: This is an introductory post to a threat hunting series that I will be doing on my blog post where I will dive into various threat samples (malware, pcaps, etc) in order to discuss methods to discover various threats. In this particular post, I will be diving into a pcap of the Foudre C2 backdoor which can be found in this Github repo and using Pandas.
Getting Our Data Ready The C2 data that we currently have is in a pcap format, but we can&amp;rsquo;t throw this file into something like Pandas to analyze it efficiently in this particular format.</description>

      <title>Windows API Programming with Python</title>

      <description>Description: Programming with the Windows API in Python, utilizing the ctypes library
NOTE: When you&amp;rsquo;re interacting with the WinAPI, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that some functions end in a W (EX: CreateFileW) while there are also the equivalent which end in an A (EX:CreateFileA). The difference is that functions ending in an A are ANSI functions while those that end in W are Unicode functions. In my experience, Python works best with the Unicode (W) functions.</description>
